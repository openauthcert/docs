# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## What is OpenAuthCert?

A public-interest certification program recognizing software projects that provide free, non-paywalled access to SSO/IdP features.

## Who can apply for a badge?

Any vendor or project maintainer with a qualifying open or self-hosted integration.

## Does this cost anything?

No. All badge applications and reviews are free.

## What protocols are accepted?

OpenID Connect (OIDC), SAML 2.0, LDAP, Kerberos, and others. See [`criteria-v0.1.md`](./certification/criteria-v0.1.md) for full list.

## Do I need to be open source?

Not necessarily. You must provide access to the integration and documentation freely — but full source code is not required.

## Can my badge be revoked?

Yes, if your project stops complying with eligibility requirements. See [`revocation-policy.md`](./certification/revocation-policy.md).

## How is this different from self-promotion?

All badges are reviewed and verified by community and contributor council members. It’s a shared trust mark, not a marketing badge.

## Who funds this?

We are independently maintained by volunteers and open contributors, with plans for a formal nonprofit foundation.

## Where can I report abuse or issues?

Open an issue in the relevant repo or email contact@openauthcert.org.
