# Decision-Making Process

The OpenAuthCert Foundation uses a transparent, contributor-driven process to propose, evaluate, and ratify decisions related to badge definitions, policies, and governance.

## Proposal Lifecycle

1. **Proposal Draft**
   - Created via GitHub issue or pull request
   - Clearly defines purpose, scope, and affected components

2. **Community Discussion**
   - Open comment period (minimum 7 days)
   - All stakeholders may participate

3. **Council Deliberation**
   - Contributor Council reviews feedback
   - May request revisions or escalate to vote

4. **Approval or Rejection**
   - Routine decisions: simple majority of council
   - Critical changes (governance, badge criteria): 2/3 supermajority

5. **Implementation and Versioning**
   - Merged via PR
   - Assigned a semantic version increment if applicable
   - Documented publicly in `docs/` and release notes

## Transparency

- All proposals and votes are public
- Council decisions are documented in GitHub issues or a changelog

## Emergency Procedure

In cases of serious misconduct, legal compliance, or security issues, an emergency vote may be triggered by any two council members. Action may be taken within 48 hours, with full documentation to follow.
